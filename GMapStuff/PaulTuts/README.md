Whatever me and David were discussing is now there.

To access the markers, user will have to put in the password for it (which is not implemented for the sake of simpliciy).

Maps contains markers of the cloud anchor locations.

Upon pressing the marker, image containing the location of the cloud anchor is shown.

Cloud Anchors can be used to generate more information about the location.

"Location as a password" works because the cloud anchors cannot be generated unless you are near it.

I encountered a problem where the view containing the information would generate, even when the anchor hasn't
generated, but this was resolved via having the view only generate what the anchor has been successfully resolved.
