	\item Reverse proxies (middle ware) are generally used to mitigate which users have access to the contents inside the database. \\
		This is what's commonly called the back-end.
	\item How the database interacts with rest of the app is also something to be concerned about upon being onboarded. \\
		This is often overlooked by many developers that just got into the industry.
	\item Get an understanding of how the CI/CD is done at the software shop.

	\item [\textbf{Graduate Thesis}]
	\item More often than not, your program will want you to maintain certain amount of GPA. The school I went to wanted all their students to maintain GPA of 3.0.
	\item You don't necessarily need to have a thesis in mind before choosing your advisor because they will spoon feed you if you don' have any idead; \\
		however, it's better if you do because, more often than not, your advisor will lead you to some where that's completely bogus.
