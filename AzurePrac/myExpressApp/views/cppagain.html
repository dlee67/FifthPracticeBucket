        I still remember when this man told me only way to go faster is to go slower, <br/>
        and I still remember John telling me that to save time is to waste time. <br/><br/>

        Here we go, again. <br/><br/>

    <h1 style="color:red">Preprocessor</h1>
    <p> 
        It performs basic code manipulation.<br/><br/>

        Directives like #include "cstio" instructs the preprocessor to include information about the cstdio.

    <p> 
        Compilers generate object file, but object files themselves are not executable. 
    </p>
    <h1 style="color:red">Linkers</h1>
    <p> 
        Linkers are what generates the executable, which is responsible to finding the libraries those are required, <br/>

    <p>
        Those are called scope operators, in the below: <br/><br/>
        
        class Rectangle { <br/>
            int width, height; <br/>
          public: <br/>
            int area() {return width*height;} <br/>
            void set_values (int,int); <br/>
            void sayHello() { <br/>
                cout << "Hello!" << "\n"; <br/>
            } <br/>
            void sayHello(string name) { <br/> // As you can see, all the polymorphism concepts from Java can apply here too.
                cout << "Hello! " << name; <br/>
            }
        };<br/><br/> 
        
        // The :: is something called scope operator.<br/>
        void Rectangle::set_values (int x, int y) {<br/>
          width = x;<br/>
          height = y;<br/>
        }<br/><br/>

        scope operator is being used to defined a method outside of the Rectangle's scope. <br/>
        However, in order use this technique, the method must be forward declared beforehand. <br/><br/>

        How do I import files in C++?

        The answer is: <h4> you don't.</h4> <br/><br/>
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4940489/include-c-file-to-another-c-file">
            it's a better practice to link files via header files.
        </a><br/><br/>

        It's generally a best practice to include directives to prevent header files being read twice.<br/><br/>

        </a><br/><br/>

        By looking at Ben's Github repo:<br/>
        <a href="https://github.com/loetus/3Brothers/blob/master/three.cpp">3Brothers</a> <br/><br/>

        OOP seems to be done like this ... (and I can't believe the redundancy).<br/>
        Header file with forward declarations is created ------> Cpp file with the definitions is created, let's call this file A -----> Cpp file that actually contains the logic uses A.<br/><br/>
        
        Any other C++ files trying to utilize an "object" as we know it in Java must be done this way.<br/>
        In a way, since, it obligates structures, I like it in theory, but not so sure about it in practice. <br/>
        The above might be the reason why I am seeing bunch of scope operators popping up left and right ...
