        Was watching the below videos today:
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_J13cA4Gj8">Cypress.io – The State of the Art End to End Testing Tool</a> <br/>

    <p>
        Selenium wasn't working when I was playing around with Electron, maybe Cypress will be different?

        Checked my bank account today, and my subscription was actually refunded.<br/>
        Can hardly it because this was my first positive experience with cloud support ever.

        Was going over the below today:

    <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/"> https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/</a>
    <p>
        And they were very helpful. </br>
        I never knew that exposing your container for traffic can be easy as what they have.

    <h3> I met Uncle Bob. </h3>
    <p>
            Q: I am currently reading this book called “The Software Craftmanship,”  <br/>
            and the author states that having a dedicated QA team is an anti-pattern. Why is that the case? <br/><br/>
            A: So, why the do you think a company is organizing a dedicated QA team for us? <br/>
            They don't trust us, even if we can automate tests! They get raises when they find bugs,<br/> 
            They want bugs! If they are not writing tests, then their existance is an anti-pattern.<br/><br/>

            “Self driving cars is a mad dream … <br/>
            We are now at a plateau for our computing machineries … <br/>
            the exponential rate is now gone, BUT WE ARE ACTING AS WE THOUGH WE HAVE IT ..." <br/> <br/>

    <h3> I met Intel engineers. </h3>
    <p>
            Q: (That stereotypical how can I be a better programmer question)  <br/><br/>
            A: First of all, gaining more experiences doesn't make you into a better developer; <br/>
            after all, you are concentrating on a 2 or more projects for years, not furnishing on other things.<br/> 
            Try different things, find the place where you want to be at.<br/><br/>

            Turns out, good portion of the engineers I've met at the conference were initially just programmers without
            any HPC backgrounds, but they somehow strolled into HPC programming.<br/><br/>

            Except this one guy who showed me the physical form of DC Optane, where he got his fundings cut off twice, 
            and grad school telling him to go take classes again ... that sucks.

    <h1>Summer/18</h1>
    <p>
        I remember working at Trimble, and this intern came up to our cubicles, asking for a software development position. <br/>
        One of my senior told that person to follow the formal procedure by applying to a position you are interested in the website. <br/>
        I still remember my other senior smirking and stating, "gotta follow the rules if you want to play in the big league." <br/>
