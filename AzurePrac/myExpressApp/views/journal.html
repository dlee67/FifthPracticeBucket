        I should do the whole oil change thing during the morning (I might not even need to do a PTO, if I get up early enough), <br/> 
        and go to work during the after noon. <br/><br/>

        My visit to Mines might be best to do on 01/30/19 <br/>
        because the conference starts at 1:30-pm, and the traning day allows me to do whatever I want that day, <br/>
        as long as I grab useful stuff from the conference.

        Let's try to understand the rest of the GRE concepts on Jan 21st by taking PTO and goto school. </br><br/>

        PTO pm on Thursday (to take a visit to Mines) and PTO on Jan 21st. <br/><br/>

        Then, til Jan 21st, let's just spend all my time on Docker and stuff. <br/><br/>

        Then, when at home, let's try to take care of that OSS test. <br/><br/>

        I should skip chapter 5 and 6, and head on over to chapter 7, after finishing 4. <br/>
        I should at least read all the section 2.<br/><br/>

        Skookum is hiring for an Android developer, <br/>
        I wonder if they'll let me work after 6-pm? <br/>
        However, they don't have the job opening for it, so, I have to DM paulcullenrowe in the Denver Dev Slack.

        There is this company name buffer, and they are currently looking for an Andy dev. <br/>
        <a href="https://journey.buffer.com/android-engineer/en"> Andy dev position for Buffer. </a> <br/>
        The above position has the most probability of allowing me to work after 6. <br/><br/>

        Let's try to really understand Docker volume mechanism today,<br/>
        and spend rest of the school time studying GRE (maybe I should consider purchsing Chegg?). <br/>

        (Done)
        I should ask Ahern if GRE is really just composed with the pre-algebra <br/>
        and algebra concepts, just like the GRE review packet implies.<br/><br>

        A: Yes, GRE math only has highschool math ...

        Q: I just went through the entire GRE Math section, and there aren't any <br/>
        concepts those consistute as Calculus, or beyond. When you were taking GRE, <br/>
        did you see any concepts those are considered a Calculus or above? <br/><br/>

        I should skip chapter 5 and 6, and head on over to chapter 7, after finishing 4. <br/>
        I should at least read all the section 2.<br/><br/>

        However, I still don't have a clear goal on how I should approach. <br/>
        The major blockage at the moment is that I don't have any firm grasp on the <br/>
        concepts those are required. <br/><br/>

        To solve the above problem, maybe I need to invest significant amount of my time <br/>
        to study'em via using PTO's at the right moments.<br/><br/>

        Plan is to ... <br/>
        figure out when Mines' office opens. <br/>
        halt on week one, day five. If I don't understand the concepts those are being used <br/>
        in the math section, then, the amount of overhead that will be caused from trying to <br/>
        solve practice problems alone will cause more time loss. <br/>
        Let's try to understand the concepts on the problems I've gotten wrong. <br/><br/>

        Embedded progromming vs just programming "these days ..." <br/>
        After hanging around in the field for a bit, I think I know the differences between <br/>
        the embedded development and development "these days."<br/><br/>

        Development these days target a platform, instead of a hardware; <br/>
        meaning, Android programming targets Android, the platform, thus, it is <br/>
        considered as an Android programming. <br/>
        Another example is a web development, which targets the browser. <br/><br/>

        On the other side of things, embedded development targets a hardware, instead <br/>
        of the software platform; for example, developing for BeagleBone is generally <br/>
        is considered as an embeded development, due to the fact I am targetting a <br/>
        hardware to program. <br/><br/>
        We have a weird relationship happening in Android programming because AOSP <br/>
        in itself is already embedded (because it's targetting ARM Cortex-M chips), <br/>
        so, when we program the AOSP itself, it becomes the embedded Android programming, <br/>
        but programming on top of AOSP becomes just android development ...

        1st priority - GRE - Registration deadline date is = 02/28/20, and the actual test date is = 04/04/20 - HP <br/>
        2nd priority - Docker and kubernetes for work -> let's tackle this with the 2 hours rule for my work. <br/> 
        3rd - My C/C++ journey - this is life long <br/>

        Then, how will I juggle those priorities through out the weekdays and weekends? <br/>
        Mon through Fri = Job, Docker & Kuber, and GRE study (wait, what about the MeetUps? <br/>
        If I am going to MeetUp, I am essentially sarificing GRE, <br/>
        unless I am using my precious PTO or floating ...). <br/>

        After trying to infatuate myself in the world of embedded stuff and C++, <br/>
        it seems like majority of the culture still has to do with C for Embedded ... <br/>
        In fact, I don't even know if C++ has a place in the embedded world or kernel development, they both use C heavily. <br/>
        Maybe I should further look at the belows?<br/>

        After research more abot Qt and stuff, I don't think there are additional significant learnings I can do. <br/>
        Maybe it's time to research on how C++ is used in the industry?<br/><br/>

        Well, Android uses it for NDK ... <br/>
        Spectra uses it for Robotics. <br/>
        Facebook wants C++ proggers for their new, hot, brand new OS for their AR device <br/>

        RedHeadband currently needs the below implementations:<br/><br/>

        From the main editor, the app needs to take the class name for its temp file. <br/><br/>

        Then, it needs to crop away the XXXXX that gets appended to the temp file name. <br/><br/>

        Finally, the app has to compile and run the app, that's it. <br/><br/>

        I reached out to Mines Alum, and this is what he told me ...
        1. Re programming in academia. <br/>
        Researchers usually don't care about optimizing or scalability. <br/>
        They care about SPEED. If your dirty/bruteforce solution works and yields some results, that's great. <br/>
        You want to be the FIRST one to get your research work published before anyone else does <br/>
        (e.g., We found a solution to this problem, here's our result so far...we will iterate more in future publications). <br/>
        In industry, people focus a lot more on implementation/engineering. <br/>
        Most companies have code review in the process so your code will be evaluated by other engineers before going to production <br/>
        (i.e., you don't want your new feature to crash the entire website which can lose billions of dollars). <br/>
        If you write bad code every time, you likely will have a bad performance review and won't get promoted. <br/>
        And no, you won't have to disregard any wisdom and intuition you have gained thus far from the industry. <br/>
        In fact, I find that people who have interned/worked in the industry actually have better software engineering standards and habits. <br/>
        In academia, try to strive a balance between speed and quality. <br/>
        In most cases, don't "overengineer/perfect" your solution. <br/>
        2. Depending on your advisor. <br/>
        Always show up on time and ready to lab meeting or one-on-on discussion with your them. <br/>
        This means have an agenda of talking points. Also, have your own opinions. <br/>
        Professors tend to like students who can defend their own ideas and support with work with prior literature/research work. <br/>
        Don't just agree with them because they are your professors. Professors can be wrong, too. <br/>
        Be independent. Read relevant research papers (maybe 3-4 per week) <br/>
        to be up to date with your research field and be informed of how other <br/>
        researchers are investigating similar problem so you don't repeat their work. <br/>
        Researchers always aim to do novel work. <br/>
        Lastly, try to schedule at least one check-in meeting with them every week so they know what you're up to. <br/>
        You are given lots of independence so if you don't check with them frequently, <br/>
        you may go in a different direction than what your professor may expect. Communication is key. <br/>

        Regarding the RedHeadband:<br/>

        Was talking with one of the students at MSU Denver, and got to show him what I made at LHD. <br/><br/>

        He started to talk about how AR would be helpful to visualize certain things for scientists.<br/><br/>

        We started to look at things from the ecologist's persepctive; for example, let's say I am an ecologist,
        and I am at some lake to do a study. <br/>

        Just carrying around the pictures containing information of the place isn't enough; as the time pass by, <br/>
        structure of the lake could change, and whatever picture the I have might've taken during the day when I am <br/>
        doing my research at night, where the information and the picture could mislead me. <br/><br/>

        With AR and the ckoud anchors, however, I can conduct my research on the lake more easily because information <br/>
        that I need are around the site, anchored, with little room for incoherency. <br/> <br/>

        Through this conversation, I can tie a data to a very specific location, not only a password. <br/><br/>

        Ultimately, ARObjects can be tied to whatever we have in our reality. <br/><br/>

        I think I understand the reason why dynamic programming is super popular. <br/>
        Things like NgRx, Redux, and ReactiveX in general <br/>
        enables the prorgrammers to nicely deal with asynchrounously processes data. <br/> <br/>
        
        For example, in Firebase, there are a lot things done asynchrounously, <br/>
        and ReactiveX will lessen the pain dramatically by always having state listening for those changes done asynchrounously, <br/>
        while being completely decoupled.

    <p>
        Around 1-am or so, I learned that being relatable to someone with no dev related skills and culturally different, or bouncing ideas with them, is very important. <br/>
        I met my old friend name David, and he told me stories about LA's party culture. <br/>
        Absolutely disgusting and quite horifying from an outsider's perspective. <br/>
        He even stated that some of the stuffs he has seen are demanted enough to question his life. <br/>
        Anyways, I showed him my apps, and soon after, he had an idea that could be implemented. <br/><br/>

        "Why can't we write an application that gives out the location of some party through Google Map (only with some special code), <br/>
        but only show the details when the user arrives at the designated location?" <br/> <br/>

        I thought to myself, "well, why don't you just show the users the details soon as the code has been received?" <br/>

        He just thought people love s*** like AR, and they will blow money on anything that looks cool; <br/>
        
        after some silence, I realized where he was getting at. <br/>
        
        In relatively underground scenes in LA and New York, party scenes needs to be more secure and exclusive; <br/>
        because of this, empty looking warehouse without any suspicion tends to be filled with ravers. <br/><br/>

        Some clubs had "exclusive features," provided only to the dedicated VIPs of their club (all of them he told me were horrible). <br/>

        He was trying to tell me that location itself is the secondary password to access additional information about the party, <br/>
        where the Cloud Anchor or Spatial Anchor object contains the details of it; after all, they can only be generated when they are at the actual location. <br/><br/>

        This idea doesn't have to be used for illegal stuff, but it could also be used for professors <br/>
        hiding details about additional class room meetups, or conference administrators hiding details <br/>
        about special dinner invites (Facebook was handing out physical invitations to CppCon attendees, where one could dig through the garbage can and get accepted, which I kinda did ...) <br/>
        
        I am gonna try to implement something like the above during this year's Local Hack Day. <br/>

        Maybe, lesson I've learned from this meeting with him is that developers are here for the folks with no dev skills, <br/>
        it was never the other way around.

    <h3> I met Intel engineers. </h3>
    <p>
            Intel HPC happened again, and they had enough money to rent out an entire opera house to host their own conference. <br/>

            Q: (That stereotypical how can I be a better programmer question)  <br/><br/>
            A: First of all, gaining more experiences doesn't make you into a better developer; <br/>
            after all, you are concentrating on a 2 or more projects for years, not furnishing on other things.<br/> 
            Try different things, find the place where you want to be at.<br/><br/>

            Turns out, good portion of the engineers I've met at the conference were initially just programmers without
            any HPC backgrounds, but they somehow strolled into HPC programming.<br/><br/>

            Except this one guy who showed me the physical form of DC Optane, where he got his fundings cut off twice, 
            and grad school telling him to go take classes again ... that sucks. <br/><br/>

            A: So, why the do you think a company is organizing a dedicated QA team for us? <br/>
            They don't trust us, even if we can automate tests! They get raises when they find bugs,<br/> 
            They want bugs! If they are not writing tests, then their existance is an anti-pattern.<br/><br/>
