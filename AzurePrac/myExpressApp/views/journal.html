        Study for GRE (done). <br/><br/>

        I still have to learn more about on testing ngrx stuffs. <br/><br/>

        I'd like to go over the materials in Qt5 C++ GUI Programming Cookbook <br/><br/>

        From the looks of things, to understand ngRx, there is a need to recognize that <br/>
        I have an entity called "Store," which is completely beyond my control, <br/>
        but I need to give and get states from it. <br/>
        Also, <br/><br/>

        <img href="https://ngrx.io/generated/images/guide/store/state-management-lifecycle.png"/>
        I need to recognize that selectors aren't needed, the Store can directly interact <br/>
        with a component without going through a selector. <br/>
        (I should refer the work project for the below) <br/>
        Q: Can I not have multiple Stores? Even if I initiallize <br/>
        multple Store objects, not intended Store object ends up gettings the dispatch.<br/>

        Q: Do I have to start attending Mines right after I get accepted? <br/>
        A: After you get the admission letter, you can deferr it up to a year.<br/>
        Q: Is it possible for me to take under-grad courses while being in the grad program? <br/>
        A: Yes.<br/>
        Q: I have a green card, do I have to take TOFFLE? <br/>
        A: No. <br/>
        Q: Do I have to take the subject GRE? <br/>
        A: No, you don't have to take the GRE the math majors take. <br/>
        Q: I don't see any courses that has to do with embedded/hardware related stuff for CS, are those <br/>
        strictly for the EE students?<br/>
        A: Strictly? No. You can take up to 2 classes from electrical engineering (500 level, meaning grad courses). <br/>
        Q: Is transitioning from courses to thesis possible? <br/>
        A: Yes. It's just form away. Did you know that we have also have this thing called project track? They are like mini thesis. <br/><br/>

        Here at the Angular Colorado ... <br/><br/>
    </p>
    <h3>
        What's new on Angular 9?
    </h3>
    <p>
        There is this thing called Lazy Loading, and it's suppose to be easier in Angular 9 than Angular 8. <br/><br/>

        Localization is going to be easier because the i18n isn't going to be coupled with ComponentFactory, but with the build itself(?). <br/>
        Ultimately, localization is going to be uber simple. <br/><br>

        We are going to have 3 different types of type checking, <br/>
        where we get basic mode, full mode, and strict mode (this is actually super cool, I don't know why this wasn't on the cheat-sheet). <br/><br/>

        In Angular 9, we have this thing called console debugging (this is exclusive to Ng 9).<br/>
    </p>
    <h3>
        CSS and Angular
    </h3>
    <p>
        He talked about how HTML you have in Angular project, <br/>
        it's actually rendered to an HTML again to suit what browser is actually looking for. <br/><br/>

        He suggested for us to go learn more about the CSS-Grid.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Angular and Auth0.
    </h3>
    <p>
        Login stuff is hard, why not use the authetication service? <br/><br/>

        We have this thing called authorization server, and it gives you ID tokes to identify the user. <br/>
        Then, the thing should give you the auth token, where the user can actually gain the access.<br/><br/>

        Say, the server got the ID token from the user, then, the server will give the cookie to the user (which is the grant).<br/>
        That's generally how the authentication is done.<br/><br/>

        (She mentioned about how all Angular apps are single page app)<br/>
        These days, client-server only have to exchange JSON because of the above.<br/>
        The best practice (2019) for token exchange isn't really new beucause mobile dev culture has been doing this for a while now ... <br/><br/>

        However, the above approach was created for the sake of creating a best practice. <br/>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Static Site generation and Ng
    </h3>
    <p>
        First of all ... <br/>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">what is a static web page?</a><br/><br/>

        What's Scully?<br/>
        "Do you have a friend who trasitions to React?" <br/>
        Well, whatever reasons those transitioned away to React, Scully can do it now. <br/><br/>

        Appearantly, this idea called static web page is old, and he brings this point.<br/>
        So, why the heck are we talking about this? <br/><br/>

        Because 80% of the internet usages are being done in a phone. <br/>
        <a href="https://angular.io/guide/universal"> and this doesn't feel like an Angular ... so ... </a><br/>
        <a href="https://github.com/scullyio/scully"> use this.</a><br/>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Best unit test practices
    </h3>
    <p>
        1.) Write the tests first because writing tests first ensures that there are tests.<br/>
        (I didn't know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_syndrome">this</a> was a thing). <br/>
        2.) There is difference between testable code and working code. Well tested code is well encapsulated and more decoupled <br/>
        because of the innate nature in testable code.<br/><br/>

        His corner stone is this, <br/>
        "does writing tests for your unit outweight the value unit testing is suppose to bring? <br/>
        Then don't; however (big however), <br/>
        we need to recognize the fact that there are many ways to reduced the cost of writing test, <br/>
        like, increasing the referential transpanrecy is one."<br/>
    </p>
    <h3>
        SVG and ngRx = wow, that's cool.
    </h3>
    <p>
        Can have CSS (style) and JavaScript (logic) attach to'em. <br/>
        In fact, you can have Angular attach to'em. <br/><br/>

        He has a repo for it, and I should go checkout.

        9-9:30, I have an appointment with a Mines grad stuff person on Jan 30th. <br/><br/>

        I should start thinking about the questions I will be asking for the Mines person and for the Angular professionals.<br/><br/>

        Let's figure out how actions are used in VE and VE-lite. <br/><br/>

        For the Mines person:<br/>
        Q: Do I have to start attending Mines right after I get accepted? <br/>
        Q: Is it possible for me to take under-grad courses while being in the grad program? <br/>
        Q: I have a green card, do I have to take TOFFLE? <br/>
        Q: Do I have to take the subject GRE? <br/>
        Q: I don't see any courses that has to do with embedded/hardware related stuff for CS, are those <br/>
        strictly for the EE students?<br/><br/>

        I need to get a tutoring help on data analysis, problem 11 and 19.

        There is a type of GRE that's called subject GRE. <br/>
        It's usually for the Math major, but I think it's still safe to ask them if I need to take it.

        Perfect timing, I just got finished with the whole Docker learning. <br/><br/>

        Ben wants the application to spin things in the back ground, and be able to communicate with REST API. <br/>
        He suggested me to go learn ...
        <br/><br/>

        cpp-httplib <br/>
        and multi-threading on Qt. <br/><br/>

        Seems like I am relatively comfortable with Docker now, but looks like we are not going to use Kubernetes any time soon.<br/>
        It might be a good time for me to freeze my progress for the above journey.<br/><br/>

        (Done)
        I should ask Ahern if GRE is really just composed with the pre-algebra <br/>
        and algebra concepts, just like the GRE review packet implies.<br/><br>

        A: Yes, GRE math only has highschool math ...

        Q: I just went through the entire GRE Math section, and there aren't any <br/>
        concepts those consistute as Calculus, or beyond. When you were taking GRE, <br/>
        did you see any concepts those are considered a Calculus or above? <br/><br/>

        I should skip chapter 5 and 6, and head on over to chapter 7, after finishing 4. <br/>
        I should at least read all the section 2.<br/><br/>

        However, I still don't have a clear goal on how I should approach. <br/>
        The major blockage at the moment is that I don't have any firm grasp on the <br/>
        concepts those are required. <br/><br/>

        To solve the above problem, maybe I need to invest significant amount of my time <br/>
        to study'em via using PTO's at the right moments.<br/><br/>

        Plan is to ... <br/>
        figure out when Mines' office opens. <br/>
        halt on week one, day five. If I don't understand the concepts those are being used <br/>
        in the math section, then, the amount of overhead that will be caused from trying to <br/>
        solve practice problems alone will cause more time loss. <br/>
        Let's try to understand the concepts on the problems I've gotten wrong. <br/><br/>

        Embedded progromming vs just programming "these days ..." <br/>
        After hanging around in the field for a bit, I think I know the differences between <br/>
        the embedded development and development "these days."<br/><br/>

        Development these days target a platform, instead of a hardware; <br/>
        meaning, Android programming targets Android, the platform, thus, it is <br/>
        considered as an Android programming. <br/>
        Another example is a web development, which targets the browser. <br/><br/>

        On the other side of things, embedded development targets a hardware, instead <br/>
        of the software platform; for example, developing for BeagleBone is generally <br/>
        is considered as an embeded development, due to the fact I am targetting a <br/>
        hardware to program. <br/><br/>
        We have a weird relationship happening in Android programming because AOSP <br/>
        in itself is already embedded (because it's targetting ARM Cortex-M chips), <br/>
        so, when we program the AOSP itself, it becomes the embedded Android programming, <br/>
        but programming on top of AOSP becomes just android development ...

        In fact, I don't even know if C++ has a place in the embedded world or kernel development, they both use C heavily. <br/>
        Maybe I should further look at the belows?<br/>

        <br/><br/>

        3.) What's general GRE score? <br/>
        4.) If I do get accepted into the program, do I have to start attending Mines right away? <br/>
            Or, is it possible for me to start attending next year? <br/>
        5.) If the computer science program only requires the score in Math, <br/>

        After research more abot Qt and stuff, I don't think there are additional significant learnings I can do. <br/>
        Maybe it's time to research on how C++ is used in the industry?<br/><br/>

        Well, Android uses it for NDK ... <br/>
        Spectra uses it for Robotics. <br/>
        Facebook wants C++ proggers for their new, hot, brand new OS for their AR device <br/>
        Maybe I should attend that C++ meetup after all and ask around? <br/><br/>

        Some books I should glance over in the future ... <br/>

        RedHeadband currently needs the below implementations:<br/><br/>

        From the main editor, the app needs to take the class name for its temp file. <br/><br/>

        Then, it needs to crop away the XXXXX that gets appended to the temp file name. <br/><br/>

        Finally, the app has to compile and run the app, that's it. <br/><br/>

        I reached out to Mines Alum, and this is what he told me ...
        1. Re programming in academia. <br/>
        Researchers usually don't care about optimizing or scalability. <br/>
        They care about SPEED. If your dirty/bruteforce solution works and yields some results, that's great. <br/>
        You want to be the FIRST one to get your research work published before anyone else does <br/>
        (e.g., We found a solution to this problem, here's our result so far...we will iterate more in future publications). <br/>
        In industry, people focus a lot more on implementation/engineering. <br/>
        Most companies have code review in the process so your code will be evaluated by other engineers before going to production <br/>
        (i.e., you don't want your new feature to crash the entire website which can lose billions of dollars). <br/>
        If you write bad code every time, you likely will have a bad performance review and won't get promoted. <br/>
        And no, you won't have to disregard any wisdom and intuition you have gained thus far from the industry. <br/>
        In fact, I find that people who have interned/worked in the industry actually have better software engineering standards and habits. <br/>
        In academia, try to strive a balance between speed and quality. <br/>
        In most cases, don't "overengineer/perfect" your solution. <br/>
        2. Depending on your advisor. <br/>
        Always show up on time and ready to lab meeting or one-on-on discussion with your them. <br/>
        This means have an agenda of talking points. Also, have your own opinions. <br/>
        Professors tend to like students who can defend their own ideas and support with work with prior literature/research work. <br/>
        Don't just agree with them because they are your professors. Professors can be wrong, too. <br/>
        Be independent. Read relevant research papers (maybe 3-4 per week) <br/>
        to be up to date with your research field and be informed of how other <br/>
        researchers are investigating similar problem so you don't repeat their work. <br/>
        Researchers always aim to do novel work. <br/>
        Lastly, try to schedule at least one check-in meeting with them every week so they know what you're up to. <br/>
        You are given lots of independence so if you don't check with them frequently, <br/>
        you may go in a different direction than what your professor may expect. Communication is key. <br/>

        Objectives:

        to prevent outselves heading into the wrong direction. <br/><br/>

        The current user story that I am on requires the BrowserWindows to be transparent. <br/>

        Regarding the RedHeadband:<br/>
        1.) No line numbers.<br/>
        2.) The layout isn't expanding gracefully when you resize the window.<br/>
        3.) It's slow for a simple app...?

        Whatever code/GUI I look at, I need to start generating the "branching tree of concepts," in my head <br/>
        Meaning, when I look at BrowserWindow, I need to start drawing a tree in my head, notifying myself things like ... <br/><br/>

        BrowserWindow can be transparent ... <br/>
        can have backgroud colors ... <br/>
        can change fontsize ... <br/><br/>

        in a form of tree. In a form of tree because node can branch out to something ... <br/><br/>

        Electron has two processes: <br/><br/>

        Renderer process and main process. <br/><br/>

        All BrowserWindows are wrapped in renderer process, and the process gets destroyed when the window gets destroyed. <br/><br/>

        Was talking with one of the students at MSU Denver, and got to show him what I made at LHD. <br/><br/>

        He started to talk about how AR would be helpful to visualize certain things for scientists.<br/><br/>

        We started to look at things from the ecologist's persepctive; for example, let's say I am an ecologist,
        and I am at some lake to do a study. <br/>

        Just carrying around the pictures containing information of the place isn't enough; as the time pass by, <br/>
        structure of the lake could change, and whatever picture the I have might've taken during the day when I am <br/>
        doing my research at night, where the information and the picture could mislead me. <br/><br/>

        With AR and the ckoud anchors, however, I can conduct my research on the lake more easily because information <br/>
        that I need are around the site, anchored, with little room for incoherency. <br/> <br/>

        Through this conversation, I can tie a data to a very specific location, not only a password. <br/><br/>

        Ultimately, ARObjects can be tied to whatever we have in our reality. <br/><br/>

        I think I understand the reason why dynamic programming is super popular. <br/>
        Things like NgRx, Redux, and ReactiveX in general <br/>
        enables the prorgrammers to nicely deal with asynchrounously processes data. <br/> <br/>
        
        For example, in Firebase, there are a lot things done asynchrounously, <br/>
        and ReactiveX will lessen the pain dramatically by always having state listening for those changes done asynchrounously, <br/>

        Around 1-am or so, I learned that being relatable to someone with no dev related skills and culturally different, or bouncing ideas with them, is very important. <br/>
        I met my old friend name David, and he told me stories about LA's party culture. <br/>
        Absolutely disgusting and quite horifying from an outsider's perspective. <br/>
        He even stated that some of the stuffs he has seen are demanted enough to question his life. <br/>
        Anyways, I showed him my apps, and soon after, he had an idea that could be implemented. <br/><br/>

        "Why can't we write an application that gives out the location of some party through Google Map (only with some special code), <br/>
        but only show the details when the user arrives at the designated location?" <br/> <br/>

        I thought to myself, "well, why don't you just show the users the details soon as the code has been received?" <br/>

        He just thought people love s*** like AR, and they will blow money on anything that looks cool; <br/>
        
        after some silence, I realized where he was getting at. <br/>
        
        In relatively underground scenes in LA and New York, party scenes needs to be more secure and exclusive; <br/>
        because of this, empty looking warehouse without any suspicion tends to be filled with ravers. <br/><br/>

        Some clubs had "exclusive features," provided only to the dedicated VIPs of their club (all of them he told me were horrible). <br/>

        He was trying to tell me that location itself is the secondary password to access additional information about the party, <br/>
        where the Cloud Anchor or Spatial Anchor object contains the details of it; after all, they can only be generated when they are at the actual location. <br/><br/>

        This idea doesn't have to be used for illegal stuff, but it could also be used for professors <br/>
        hiding details about additional class room meetups, or conference administrators hiding details <br/>
        about special dinner invites (Facebook was handing out physical invitations to CppCon attendees, where one could dig through the garbage can and get accepted, which I kinda did ...) <br/>
        
        I am gonna try to implement something like the above during this year's Local Hack Day. <br/>

        Maybe, lesson I've learned from this meeting with him is that developers are here for the folks with no dev skills, <br/>

        After I started to think in the mode of thinking I have when I play around with ngRX (aka Redux), <br/>
        I strated to program things with Firebase correctly.
    </p>
    <h1>11/29/19</h1>
    <p>
        Firebase does everything asynchrounously, and that's making things kinda difficult.<br/>

    <h3> SC 19 </h3>
    <p>
        Just like Gophercon, I didn't feel any growth. <br/>
    </p>
    <h1>11/19/19</h1>
    <h3> I met Intel engineers. </h3>
    <p>
            Intel HPC happened again, and they had enough money to rent out an entire opera house to host their own conference. <br/>

            Q: (That stereotypical how can I be a better programmer question)  <br/><br/>
            A: First of all, gaining more experiences doesn't make you into a better developer; <br/>
            after all, you are concentrating on a 2 or more projects for years, not furnishing on other things.<br/> 
            Try different things, find the place where you want to be at.<br/><br/>

            Turns out, good portion of the engineers I've met at the conference were initially just programmers without
            any HPC backgrounds, but they somehow strolled into HPC programming.<br/><br/>

            Except this one guy who showed me the physical form of DC Optane, where he got his fundings cut off twice, 
            and grad school telling him to go take classes again ... that sucks. <br/><br/>

            They talked about about Intel One API, pmem.io, and mod simd. <br/><br/>

            "There are no answers."
    </p>
    <h1>11/19/19</h1>
    <h3> I met Uncle Bob. </h3>
    <p>
            Q: I am currently reading this book called “The Software Craftmanship,”  <br/>
            and the author states that having a dedicated QA team is an anti-pattern. Why is that the case? <br/><br/>
            A: So, why the do you think a company is organizing a dedicated QA team for us? <br/>
            They don't trust us, even if we can automate tests! They get raises when they find bugs,<br/> 
            They want bugs! If they are not writing tests, then their existance is an anti-pattern.<br/><br/>

            “Self driving cars is a mad dream … <br/>
            We are now at a plateau for our computing machineries … <br/>
            the exponential rate is now gone, BUT WE ARE ACTING AS WE THOUGH WE HAVE IT ..." <br/> <br/>

    <p>
        First time I've ever won something in the hackathon. <br/>
        I am quite proud of the fact that my application was the only AR application during the hackathon. <br/>
        Later that week, I also participated in this hackathon called Mile-high hack, and I wonder if they'll comeback?

        6명? 정도 있었는데. 증강현실 프로그램 만들어본사람은 나뿐이였고. 결국엔 혼자서만 프로그램밍을 하고있었다. <br/> 
        이긴거엔 그다지 기쁘지않았는데, 기쁜건 겨우 2일만에 실력이 증폭했다는건데. <br/>
        구글 투토리얼들이 그다지 효율성이없고, Medium article이나, 너도 나도 같은 사람들이 짠 투토리얼들이 더 더욱 효과가있었다.<br/><br/>

        근대, 그건 왜움들이지, 내 안에있는 뭐가 성장했는지 모르겠다. 고민해봐야 돼겠다.<br/><br/>

        나는 기억하고건가? 내가 결정적으로 성장했던 순간들을?<br/><br/>

        I remember now. When I was able to get a lot done in short amount of time, it was after I was looking at the below picture: <br/><br/>

        I went their with 2 other guys, but I was pretty much the only person contributing to the project. <br/>
        The other guy claimed that he was pretty fluent in ML side of things, but he literally had 0% contribution to the project. <br/>
        Wish I had a confidence like him time to time.

    <p>
        CppCon happened, and it gave me enough courage to quit one of my job. <br/>
        I learned that some learnings aren't just worth it to invest your time in because your growth is insignificant when compared to other learnings. <br/>
        I had the privillage to ask a question to Bjarne Strousp.
        <br/><br/>
        Q: As a computer science student, what are some of the pitfalls I need avoid? <br/>
        A: Don't underestimate your problem. <br/>
        Answer?: It pisses me off when people don't respect the fundamental ideas behind certain concepts!
        <br/><br/>
        Later that night, I was just walking around the conference and found a ticket lying around in the hall way for Facebook's special dinner invite. <br/>
        I went their and had a conversation with one of the lead R&D engineer for their new AR glasses.
        <br/><br/>
        He took off his glasses and told me, <br/>
        "we need to have an AR app running in something small as this, that's why we are looking for C++ programmers to create a new operating system with us."
