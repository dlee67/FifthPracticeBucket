    <string name="about_intro">
        I am going live alone for the rest of my life (at least, that\'s the plan for now),\n
        where I am a person who enjoys solitude; however,\n
        I want folks to know that there is something wrong going on in my life if there is one.\n
        \n
        That\'s why I started writing this app.\n
        \n
        It wants the user to input two phone numbers, and the amount of days before it panics.\n
        When the user presses the check-in button,\n
        it refreshes to the amount the user initially inputted for the panic.\n
        \n
        Hope you also find use in this app.
    </string>
